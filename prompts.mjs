const generic = () => `# Conversation Summary Generator

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive summary of the current conversation that will serve as instructions for another LLM to continue it seamlessly. The summary should capture essential context without unnecessary details.

Please generate a structured summary with the following sections:

1. **Conversation Overview** - Brief description of what this conversation is about (2-3 sentences)
2. **Key Participants** - Who is involved in the conversation and their roles
3. **Topics Discussed** - Major themes and subjects covered so far
4. **Key Decisions/Conclusions** - Important decisions made or conclusions reached
5. **Current Task Status** - If there's an ongoing task:
   - Description of the task
   - Steps completed so far
   - Steps remaining
   - Any blockers or challenges
6. **Important Context** - Any critical background information needed
7. **Tone and Style Notes** - How the conversation has been conducted (formal, technical, casual, etc.)

Format this summary in a clear, structured way using markdown with optional TOML front matter. Use appropriate formatting elements like:
- Checklists for tasks
- Tables for organized information
- Mermaid diagrams for visualizing relationships or processes
- Code blocks for any technical content

once you have created this summary, please save it using the 'leave_off' tool so that another llm can pick up where you left off`;
